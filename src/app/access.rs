//! Keyboard focus and screen reader support for the hand-painted controls.
//!
//! Every control goes through `control`, which makes it clickable, reachable with
//! `Tab`, `Shift+Tab` and the arrow keys (egui moves the focus between focusable
//! widgets: `Tab` in drawing order, the arrows to the nearest widget in that
//! direction), and describes it to screen readers through AccessKit. The control
//! with keyboard focus gets WinUI's focus visual. Space and Enter press the focused
//! control, except that Enter stays `=` on the calculator's keys (see
//! `CalculatorApp::handle_keyboard`).
