# CalcCraft
## 🖩 Web Live demo [https://gavrilov.github.io/calccraft/](https://gavrilov.github.io/calccraft/)
Calculator; an open-source reimplementation of Calculator, rebuilt in pure Rust with [eframe/egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui).
It looks like the original (Segoe UI fonts, Fluent icons, the same layout and colors) and behaves like it, down to how the expression line, `%`, repeated `=` and error messages work.

## Features

- **Keypad:** digits, decimal point, `+/−`, `+ − × ÷`, `=`, `%`, `CE`, `C`, `⌫`, `1/x`, `x²`, `√x`.
- **Memory:** `MC`, `MR`, `M+`, `M−`, `MS`, plus the memory list (`M˅`) with per-slot `MC` / `M+` / `M−`,
  also in each slot's right-click menu.
- **History:** every calculation is logged. Click an entry to bring it back, right-click it to copy
  or delete it, or use the trash button to clear the list.
- **Docked history and memory:** from 560 px wide, history and memory sit next to the keypad
  in a side panel with History and Memory tabs, as in Windows; narrower windows open them over
  the keypad.
- **Keep on top:** a compact always-on-top window, the same as in Windows.
- **Settings:** opened from the menu, as in Windows. It has the App theme choice, the Language and
  Regional format choices, the app version, and links for sending feedback and to the project on
  GitHub.
- **Light and dark themes:** pick Light, Dark or Use system setting in Settings. With the system
  setting, the app follows the Windows app mode, even when it changes while the app is open.
  The title bar switches with it. The choice is saved in `%APPDATA%\CalcCraft`.
- **Exact arithmetic:** numbers are stored as big rationals, so `0.1 + 0.2 − 0.3` is exactly `0`
  and `1 ÷ 3 × 3` is exactly `1`.
- **Windows behavior:** immediate execution without operator precedence (`2 + 3 × 4 = 20`),
  16 significant digits, Windows' rules for scientific notation, and the same error messages
  (`Cannot divide by zero`, `Result is undefined`, `Invalid input`, `Overflow`).
- **Keyboard and clipboard:** see the shortcuts below. `Ctrl+C` copies the result. `Ctrl+V` pastes
  a number (`1.5e3` too) or a whole expression such as `12 + 5 =`, with the same checks as Windows.
- **Keyboard navigation:** `Tab`, `Shift+Tab` and the arrow keys reach every control, with
  Windows' focus rectangle, and `Space` or `Enter` presses it (`Enter` stays `=` on the keypad).
  Menus, lists and the calendar open on their selected item and hand the focus back when they
  close.
- **Screen readers:** Narrator reads every control by its Windows name ("Positive negative",
  "Memory store", …) and announces results as they change ("Display is 7").
- **50 languages:** the interface uses the Windows Calculator's own translations and follows the
  Windows display language. Numbers, dates and the first day of the week follow your regional
  format (`1.234,5` and `15. Oktober 2026` in Germany), as in Windows. Unlike Windows, Settings
  can also set the language and the regional format for CalcCraft alone: type the first letters
  of a name to find it in the list.
- **Scientific mode** (open the ☰ menu, or `Alt+2`):
  - Operator precedence and parentheses (`2 + 3 × 4 = 14`), with the open count on `(`.
  - Powers and roots (`x²`, `x³`, `xʸ`, `10ˣ`, `2ˣ`, `eˣ`, `√x`, `∛x`, `ʸ√x`), `log`, `ln`,
    `logᵧx`, `n!` (the gamma function for fractions: `0.5!` is `√π / 2`), `|x|`, `⌊x⌋`, `⌈x⌉`,
    `mod`, `π`, `e` and `rand`; `2nd` shows the second functions.
  - The Trigonometry menu: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `sec`, `csc`, `cot`, their inverses (`2nd`) and
    hyperbolic versions (`hyp`), in degrees, radians or gradians. The Function menu adds
    `→dms` and `→deg` for degrees, minutes and seconds.
  - `exp` types an exponent (`1.5e+3`), and `F-E` switches to scientific notation.
  - 32 significant digits, as in Windows (`3.1415926535897932384626433832795`), Windows'
    error rules (`tan(90°)` is `Invalid input`) and expression line (`sin₀(30)`, `2 ^ 10 =`).
  - Its own history; memory is shared with the other modes.

![Screenshot of the scientific mode](docs/scientific.png)

- **Graphing mode** (open the ☰ menu, or `Alt+3`):
  - Up to 14 equations at once, each in its own color: functions (`y = x^2`, or just `x^2`),
    `x = …`, relations such as `x^2 + y^2 = 25`, and inequalities (`y < sin(x)`), whose region
    is dotted and whose strict boundary is dashed. Type them, or use the keypad with `2nd` and
    its Trigonometry, Inequalities and Function menus; implicit multiplication (`2x`, `mx + b`)
    works. An equation is graphed when you press `Enter` or leave its box.
  - The colored fₙ button hides and shows a line; hover a box for the function analysis, the
    line options (14 colors, solid, dashed or dotted) and remove.
  - Pan by dragging, zoom with the wheel, the + and − buttons or `Ctrl` + plus and minus. The
    view fits the equations by itself until you move it; the graph view button (`Ctrl+0`)
    brings that back.
  - Hover a curve to read a point, or turn on tracing and move its pointer with the arrow keys.
  - Free variables get sliders: `y = mx + b` gets `m` and `b`, each with its minimum, step and
    maximum.
  - **Function analysis:** domain, range, intercepts, minima and maxima, inflection points,
    asymptotes, parity, period and monotonicity, with exact values (`(√3/3 + 1, −2√3 − 6)`,
    `{(2πn₁ + π/2, 1), n₁ ∈ ℤ}`).
  - **Graph options:** the window's x and y ranges, radians, degrees or gradians, the line
    thickness, and the graph theme (always light, as in Windows, or matching the app).
  - Right-click the graph to copy it as an image, or use the share button to send the graph
    with its equations and variables through the Windows share sheet.

- **Date calculation mode** (open the ☰ menu):
  - **Difference between dates:** the difference broken into years, months, weeks and days,
    plus the total number of days (`4 years, 4 months, 4 days`, `1587 days`).
  - **Add or subtract days:** add years, months and days (0–999 each) to a date, or subtract them.
  - The date pickers open a calendar with month, year and decade views. It works with the
    arrows and the mouse wheel, and supports dates from 1601 to 9999, like Windows.

![Screenshot of the date calculation mode](docs/date-calculation.png)

- **Programmer mode** (open the ☰ menu, or `Alt+4`):
  - The value in HEX, DEC, OCT and BIN at once; click a radix to type in it. Digits that
    don't exist in the radix are disabled, and right-clicking a radix copies its value.
  - QWORD, DWORD, WORD and BYTE words in two's complement: a smaller word keeps the low
    bits, a larger one extends the sign, and decimal numbers are signed (`FF` is `-1` in a byte).
  - `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `NAND`, `NOR`, `XOR` (the Bitwise menu), shifts and rotations (the Bit
    shift menu: arithmetic, logical, circular, or through the carry bit), integer `÷` and the
    remainder `%`, all with operator precedence and parentheses, as in Windows.
  - The bit toggling keypad shows all 64 bits; click one to flip it.
  - The engine is Windows' own integer mode, quirks included: switching the radix rewrites
    the expression line, and a quotient inside parentheses keeps its fraction until they
    close (`(255 AND 10 − 7 ÷ 2)` is 6).
  - Memory is shared with the Standard mode, as in Windows; there is no history.

![Screenshot of the programmer mode](docs/programmer.png)

- **Unit converters** (under Converter in the ☰ menu): Volume, Length, Weight and mass,
  Temperature, Energy, Area, Speed, Time, Power, Data, Pressure and Angle.
  - Windows' units and conversion factors, and its rounding (at least 7 significant digits).
  - Type into either value; click the other one to convert the other way.
  - "About equal to" shows the value in other units and an everyday comparison, like
    `5.36 hands` for a meter.
  - The default units follow your Windows region, as in Windows (inches and pounds in the US,
    centimeters and kilograms elsewhere). The last converter's units are remembered.

| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab`, arrow keys | Move the keyboard focus |
| `Space` or `Enter` | Press the focused control (`Enter` is `=` on the keypad) |

In the date calculation mode, `Esc` closes the open calendar or list, `Page Up` and `Page Down`
flip the calendar's pages, and `Ctrl+C` copies the result.

In the calendar, the arrow keys move the focus by a day or a week (by a month or a year, or four,
in the year and decade views), across rows and pages, as in Windows.

In the scientific mode, these keys are added (Windows' own):

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `S` / `O` / `T` / `U` / `I` / `J` | `sin` / `cos` / `tan` / `sec` / `csc` / `cot` |
| `Shift` + those keys | The inverse functions (`sin⁻¹` …) |
| `Ctrl` + those keys, `Ctrl+Shift` + those keys | The hyperbolic functions (`sinh` …) and their inverses |
| `^` or `Y`, `Ctrl+Y` | `xʸ`, `ʸ√x` |
| `Q`, `#`, `@`, `B` | `x²`, `x³`, `√x`, `∛x` |
| `Ctrl+G`, `G`, `Ctrl+N` | `10ˣ`, `2ˣ`, `eˣ` |
| `L`, `N`, `Shift+L` | `log`, `ln`, `logᵧx` |
| `!`, `\|`, `[`, `]` | `n!`, `\|x\|`, `⌊x⌋`, `⌈x⌉` |
| `%` | `mod` |
| `P`, `Shift+E`, `Shift+R` | `π`, `e`, `rand` |
| `X` or `E`, `V` | `exp`, `F-E` |
| `M` | `→dms` |
| `R` | Reciprocal (`1/x`) |
| `F4` / `F5` / `F3` | Radians / gradians / degrees (as in Windows, each is the key of the unit button before it) |
| `(` `)` | Parentheses |

In the programmer mode, Windows' own keys apply:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `0`–`9`, `A`–`F` | Digits (`A`–`F` in HEX only) |
| `F5` / `F6` / `F7` / `F8` | HEX / DEC / OCT / BIN |
| `F2` / `F3` / `F4` / `F12` | DWORD / WORD / BYTE / QWORD |
| `&` `\|` `^` `~` | AND, OR, XOR, NOT |
| `.` `\` | NAND, NOR |
| `<` `>` | Shift or rotate left and right, as chosen in the Bit shift menu |
| `%` | Remainder (`Mod`) |
| `(` `)` | Parentheses |

`Ctrl+C` copies the value in the current radix without its digit groups, and `Ctrl+V` pastes
numbers and expressions in the current radix, C-style notation included (`0x1F` or `1Fh` in HEX,
`0b101` in BIN, `255u` or `1_000` in DEC), as long as they fit into the word size.

In the graphing mode, the keyboard types into the equation box with the focus, and:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Enter` | Graph the equation and go to the next box |
| `Ctrl` + `+` or `=`, `Ctrl` + `-` | Zoom in, zoom out |
| `Ctrl+0` | The graph view button: back to the automatic view, or keep the current one |
| Arrow keys (with `Shift`: slower) | Move the trace pointer while tracing |
| `Esc` | Stop tracing, or close an open menu or flyout |

In the converters, the digits, `.` or `,`, `Backspace` and `Delete` (`CE`) work as above,
`F9` or `-` changes the sign (Temperature, Power and Angle only), `Ctrl+C` copies the active
value, `Ctrl+V` pastes a number, and `Esc` closes an open unit list or menu, or else is `CE` too,
as in Windows.

In an open unit list or a focused unit picker, typing the first letters of a unit's name goes
to that unit, as in Windows.

## Requirements

- **Windows 10 or 11.** The app was developed and tested on Windows 11. It loads Segoe UI
  (regular, semibold and light) and Segoe UI Symbol from `%WINDIR%\Fonts`. Its icons
  ([Fluent System Icons](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-system-icons)) are built into the
  executable, and so is [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter), which takes Segoe UI's
  place where it's missing.
- **Linux (x64) and macOS (Apple silicon and Intel)** get release builds too, with Inter, a plain
  title bar and en-US regional formats, but Windows is the platform CalcCraft is made for. The
  Linux build needs X11 or Wayland and OpenGL, as any desktop has. The macOS app isn't notarized:
  open it the first time with right-click → Open (or remove the quarantine flag with
  `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine CalcCraft.app`).
- **Rust 1.95 or newer** (edition 2024; eframe 0.36 needs at least 1.95).
- **Windows SDK** (on Windows) for `rc.exe`, which embeds the icon into the executable. It comes with the
  Visual Studio C++ build tools that Rust on Windows needs anyway.
- **On Linux,** eframe's build dependencies:
  `sudo apt-get install libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libxkbcommon-dev`.

## Build and run

```bash
cargo run --release
```

The executable is `target/release/calculator.exe` (`calculator` on Linux and macOS). Release
builds use the Windows GUI subsystem, so no console window appears. Debug builds (`cargo run`) keep the console, which is
handy for logging.

## Web version

The same app runs in the browser, compiled to WebAssembly: <https://gavrilov.github.io/calccraft/>.
Every release deploys it to GitHub Pages once its desktop builds are out
([`pages.yml`](.github/workflows/pages.yml)), and it can be deployed by hand from the Actions
tab (Web → Run workflow, from `main`). It works in current Chrome, Edge, Firefox and
Safari, on desktops and phones, and keeps its settings in the browser's local storage.

It installs as an app (a PWA), which then starts from the home screen without the browser's
address bar and works offline:

- **Android:** in Chrome, ⋮ → **Install app** (or Add to Home screen).
- **iPhone and iPad:** in Safari, Share → **Add to Home Screen**. The installed app keeps its
  own settings, apart from Safari's.
- **Windows, macOS, Linux:** in Chrome or Edge, the install button in the address bar opens it
  in its own window.

The installed app updates itself: after a deployment, the next start loads the new version.
The app manifest and the service worker that keeps the app's files are
`assets/web/manifest.webmanifest` and `assets/web/sw.js`.

To run it locally, install [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev) and the WebAssembly target, then serve it
on <http://127.0.0.1:8080>:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

```bash
cargo install trunk --locked
```

```bash
trunk serve --open
```

`trunk build --release` writes the site to `dist/`. Trunk downloads the `wasm-bindgen` and
`wasm-opt` it needs; where that isn't possible, `cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli --version <the one
in Cargo.lock>` and `cargo install wasm-opt` put them on the `PATH`, where Trunk finds them.

How the browser version differs:

- **Language and formats** follow the browser's language list and `Intl`; the page address's
  `?lang=de-DE&region=de-DE` stands in for `CALCCRAFT_LANGUAGE` and `CALCCRAFT_REGION`. Chinese,
  Japanese, Korean, Thai and Amharic need fonts the page can't read from the system, so they
  aren't offered yet.
- **Window size:** on phones, tablets and small browser windows the calculator fills the page
  (smaller than 320 × 500, the page scrolls). On a large screen with a mouse it's a window in
  the middle of the page instead, 400 × 650 to start: drag the grip at its lower right corner
  to resize it (wider than 560 px, history and memory dock on the right), and double-click the
  grip to go back. The browser remembers the size. **Keep on top** is gone: a browser tab
  can't stay on top.
- **Share** in the Graphing mode downloads the graph as `graph.png`. **Paste** in an equation
  box's menu asks the browser for the clipboard, which may ask for permission first.
- **Shortcuts:** the page keeps the browser from acting on the calculator's shortcuts (Ctrl+R
  reloading, F5, F3, Ctrl+L …), but browsers never hand some to a page (Ctrl+W, Ctrl+T, Ctrl+N,
  Cmd+Q on a Mac).
- **Screen readers:** egui has no screen reader tree in the browser yet, only spoken focus
  changes; the desktop app serves screen reader users better.

## Android app (prototype)

The same app also builds as a native Android app for 64-bit ARM phones and tablets (Android 7.0
and later): `pwsh android/build-apk.ps1` writes `target/android/CalcCraft-<version>-arm64.apk`,
which installs with `adb install -r`. CI builds the same APK for every push (the run's
`CalcCraft-android-arm64` artifact), and every release has one. It isn't in Google Play yet and
still lacks the clipboard, Share and regional formats; [`android/README.md`](android/README.md)
has the requirements and the details.

## Development

```bash
cargo test                                  # unit tests
cargo fmt --check                           # formatting
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings   # lints
```

All three must pass before a change is merged, and so must the web build's lints
(`cargo clippy --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -- -D warnings`).
[GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs them on Windows, Linux and macOS, and builds the
web version, for every push and pull request.
Contributors (people and AI agents alike)
should read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) first: it describes the architecture, the Windows behaviors
that the tests pin down, and known pitfalls.

Besides the Language and Regional format settings, `CALCCRAFT_LANGUAGE` and `CALCCRAFT_REGION`
(for example `de-DE`) stand in for the Windows settings that "Use system setting" follows, which
helps testing. The strings in `locales/` come from the Windows Calculator's resource files;
after adding a string to `tools/import-strings.ps1`, regenerate them from a clone of
[microsoft/calculator](https://github.com/microsoft/calculator):

```bash
pwsh tools/import-strings.ps1 -Source ../win-calculator
```

The few strings Windows doesn't have (the Language and Regional format settings) are
CalcCraft's own, translated by hand in `locales/calccraft.txt`.

## Releasing

Bump `version` in `Cargo.toml`, merge that change, then push a tag with the same version:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
```

```bash
git push origin v1.0.0
```

The [release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) checks that the tag matches `Cargo.toml`
and creates a draft release with generated release notes. Then it runs the tests and builds the
app on Windows and Linux (x64), macOS (Apple silicon and Intel) and Android (arm64), and uploads
each with its SHA-256 checksum:

| Platform | File |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | `calculator-v1.0.0-windows-x64.exe` |
| Linux | `calculator-v1.0.0-linux-x64.tar.gz` (the `calculator` executable) |
| macOS (Apple silicon) | `calculator-v1.0.0-macos-arm64.zip` (`CalcCraft.app`, signed ad hoc) |
| macOS (Intel) | `calculator-v1.0.0-macos-x64.zip` (`CalcCraft.app`, signed ad hoc, cross-compiled on Apple silicon) |
| Android | `calculator-v1.0.0-android-arm64.apk` (signed with the release key from the repository's secrets, see [`android/README.md`](android/README.md)) |

The draft is published only when all five are there. Tags with a suffix, such as
`v1.0.0-beta.1`, are published as pre-releases.

## Differences from Windows Calculator

- All modes and 12 of the 13 converters exist. The Currency converter is not implemented.
- The graphing mode has its own math engine (Windows' is proprietary):
  - Equations are plain text laid out like math (italic variables, raised exponents), not
    Windows' math editor, so a fraction stays `1/x` instead of being built up. Functions beyond
    the keypad's (Windows' `deriv`, `integral` …) aren't supported.
  - The function analysis is numeric, with the results written as the integers, fractions,
    multiples of π and square roots they are; other values are decimals (6 significant digits),
    where Windows' symbolic engine would give an exact form. Features beyond ±1000 aren't found.
  - The automatic view uses CalcCraft's own rules. They match Windows' view for `x^2`, and give
    similar ones elsewhere.
  - A share's title is "CalcCraft" instead of Windows' "Look what I graphed with Windows
    Calculator".
- The icons are Fluent System Icons built into the app, not Windows' Segoe Fluent Icons: they
  are the same designs in most places, but not every line is identical. Six converter icons in
  the menu (Volume, Weight and mass, Temperature, Speed, Data, Angle), the Programmer mode's icons
  and the Scientific mode's key labels (`x²`, `xʸ`, `2ⁿᵈ`, …) and menu icons are similar icons,
  Segoe UI text or drawn in code: Windows draws them from the Calculator's own icon font, which
  can't be used outside Windows.
- The Scientific mode computes its functions with about 120 digits and keeps 40, so the 32
  digits it shows are those of the exact result. Windows computes with about 32 digits, so some
  of its results may differ in the last digit.
- Dates always use the Gregorian calendar, even in regions that use another one.
- The palettes are fixed: both themes use the purple tint and accent color of the reference
  screenshots. Windows tints its window with the Mica effect and your own accent color.
  The light background is an estimate, not a sample.
- There is no high contrast theme.
- The About section in Settings shows only the name and version, without the license and
  privacy links.
- egui can't lay out right-to-left text or shape complex scripts, so Arabic, Persian, Hebrew,
  Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, Khmer and Lao users get the next language in their
  Windows language list, or English. Numbers always use Western digits, and the interface is
  never mirrored.
- The menu button's screen reader names and the calendar's arrows stay English: Windows takes
  them from places outside the Calculator's own translations.
- Pasted text loses its group separators before the decimal separator becomes a point. Windows
  does it the other way round, which loses the decimal point where the group separator is a point
  (`1,5` pastes as `15` with German formats).
- `Esc` leaves the Settings page; in Windows only the back button does.
